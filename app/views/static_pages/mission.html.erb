<h5>Mission Statement:</h5>
<p>EllaJune is a participatory media project where African Diasporic changemakers come together to create independent, transformative media for ourselves. We are currently focusing on using new media technology to create an online space where African Diasporic changemakers can keep each other inspired, share information & resources, and build meaningful relationships with like-minded individuals. We also are exploring ways to use this online space as a platform to share and support many forms of media and arts including but definitely not limited to news media, games, music, film, and video.</p>
<br>
<p>
EllaJune is organized as a multi-stakeholder cooperative, which is a hybrid between a consumer cooperative and worker cooperative. In multi-stakeholder cooperatives, producers, workers/staff and consumers (we prefer the term community members) all work together to achieve our mission and satisfy our community needs. All members have real decision-making power so that we can co-create empowering media spaces for ourselves.</p>

<h5>What Is A Black Changemaker?</h5>
<p>EllaJune is currently defining a Black changemaker as a person of the African Diaspora that is doing creative and transformative work to empower their own personal lives and to better their communities and the world. The Black changemakers of EllaJune believe in love, respect and social justice but have diverse political, spiritual, and life philosophies. Black changemakers live all over the world and have different nationalities, cultures and native languages.</p> 

<h5>Values:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Love: Love is the foundation for this community. Our members are driven by the love of their creative process, the love of transforming themselves and their communities, and the love of positive energy. We love our blackness just as we love our humanity. We love the African Diaspora just as we love the world.</li><br>
<li>Empowerment: We are creating this community together. Our members are not passive consumers. They are empowered creators that are actively building networks, support systems and transformative spaces through their work. </li><br>
<li>Openness & Transparency: We strive to move beyond the suggestion box model and give our members real power in shaping our website and community. We are working to create transparent democratic processes that empower our members to make the critical decisions that will shape the values and future of the website. We use <i><a href="https://www.loomio.org/groups/1062">loomio</a></i> to facilitate the decision-making process. Furthermore, our code base is completely open-source and accessible <i><a href ="https://github.com/ellajune/ellajune">here</a></i>. We encourage all of members to contribute code so we are working to create opportunities for our community to learn how to code.</li><br>

<h5>Ella Baker and June Jordan</h5>
<p>Ella Baker(1903–1986) was an African-American civil rights activist that worked with many organizations including the NAACP, SCLC, SNCC and the Young Negroes Cooperative League. She worked on the frontlines of the fight for democracy for over 50 years. Her organizing style is a great example of popular education and participatory democracy. She inspired us with these powerful words:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>"Strong people don't need strong leaders"</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>"The Negro must quit looking for a savior, and work to save himself."</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>"People cannot be free until there is enough work in this land to give everybody a job."</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>June Jordan(1936-2002) was a bisexual Caribbean-American writer and activist. Her writings paint our dreams of radical democracy: </p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>“I would hope that we shall once again begin to build beloved community not looking for a leader but determined to respect and activate the leadership capacities within each one of us”</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>“Misbegotten American dreams have maimed us all. And one of these, especially, continues to distort and paralyze our simplest capabilities for cooperation as a species. Beloved, national myths about you and me as gloriously rugged, independent individuals pervade our consciousness.”</blockquote></li>
</ul>
