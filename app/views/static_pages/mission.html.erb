<h5>Mission Statement:</h5>
<p>EllaJune is a cooperatively run nonprofit that contributes to the development of a sharing economy in the African Diaspora. We create spaces for African Diasporic changemakers to share support, resources and information with each other.</p>

<p>Our focus is using new media and technology to create an online community/website but our end goal is to facilitate as many spaces as possible for building radically democratic community, whether those spaces be physical or virtual.</p>

<h5>What Is A Black Changemaker?</h5>
<p>EllaJune is currently defining a Black changemaker as a person of the African Diaspora that is doing creative and transformative work to empower their own personal lives and to better their communities and the world. The Black changemakers of EllaJune believe in love, respect and social justice but have diverse political, spiritual, and life philosophies. Black changemakers live all over the world and have different nationalities, cultures and native languages.</p> 

<h5>Values:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Love: Love is the foundation for this community. Our members are driven by the love of their creative process, the love of transforming themselves and their communities, and the love of positive energy. We love our blackness just as we love our humanity. We love the African Diaspora just as we love the world.</li><br>
<li>Empowerment: We are creating this community together. Our members are not passive consumers. They are empowered creators that are actively building networks, support systems and transformative spaces through their work. </li><br>
<li>Openness & Transparency: We strive to move beyond the suggestion box model and give our members real power in shaping our website and community. We are working to create transparent democratic processes that empower our members to make the critical decisions that will shape the values and future of the website. We use <a href="https://www.loomio.org/groups/1062">loomio</a> to facilitate the decision-making process. Furthermore, our code base is completely open-source and accessible <a href ="https://github.com/ellajune/ellajune">here</a>. We encourage all of members to contribute code so we are working to create opportunities for our community to learn how to code.</li><br>
<li>Cooperativism: We strive to incorporate the principles of cooperativism into every aspect of EllaJune. We created EllaJune because we wanted to create a space where Black changemakers could cooperate and collaborate with each other.</li><br>
</ul>
